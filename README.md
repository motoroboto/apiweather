# Homework 06: Weather API

This site pulls data from openweatherapi and then gives you current weather data for the city of your choice. It will also display a 5 day forecast for that city. Finally, it will keep track of previous searches you have done so that you can return to those cities whenever you wish. When you are through with your session, you can clear your previous searches and start anew.
